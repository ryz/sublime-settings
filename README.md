# Sublime Text 2 user settings#

My [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) configuration files.

Used in conjuction with the [Flatland theme](https://github.com/thinkpixellab/flatland) and the Monokai color scheme.

[Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control) is also used.

Go to your Sublime Text 2 Packages directory

Mac OS X
    `cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 2/Packages`

Then install the required extensions:

    `git clone https://github.com/thinkpixellab/flatland.git "Theme - Flatland"`

Package Control
    `git clone https://github.com/wbond/sublime_package_control.git "Package Control"`
